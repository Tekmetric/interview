## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Model Foundation (Tasks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

#### Task 1: Create JPA Entities ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Implement the core domain model with proper JPA relationships

**Entities to create**:
- `Artist.java`
  - Fields: id (Long), name (String)
  - Relationships: One-to-Many with Songs and Albums
  - Cascade: CascadeType.REMOVE for Songs and Albums

- `Song.java`
  - Fields: id (Long), title (String), length (Duration), releaseDate (LocalDate)
  - Relationships: Many-to-One with Artist (required), Many-to-Many with Albums
  - JoinTable: song_album

- `Album.java`
  - Fields: id (Long), title (String), releaseDate (LocalDate)
  - Relationships: Many-to-One with Artist, Many-to-Many with Songs

- `SearchResult.java` (Read-only entity mapped to database view)
  - Fields: id (Long), entityType (String), name (String), artistName (String), releaseDate (LocalDate)
  - Annotation: @Immutable, @Subselect (maps to search_view)
  - Used for: Unified search across all entity types

**Package**: `com.interview.entity`

#### Task 2: Database Initialization Scripts ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Create H2 database schema and sample data

**Note**: Database view is created via @Subselect annotation in SearchResult entity. Sample data.sql includes test data for Artists, Songs, Albums, and their relationships.

**Location**: `src/main/resources/database/data.sql`

**Scripts to include**:
- CREATE TABLE statements (if not using JPA auto-generation)
- CREATE VIEW for unified search:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW search_view AS
  SELECT
    id,
    'ARTIST' as entity_type,
    name as name,
    name as artist_name,
    NULL as release_date
  FROM artist
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    s.id,
    'SONG' as entity_type,
    s.title as name,
    a.name as artist_name,
    s.release_date as release_date
  FROM song s
  JOIN artist a ON s.artist_id = a.id
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    al.id,
    'ALBUM' as entity_type,
    al.title as name,
    a.name as artist_name,
    al.release_date as release_date
  FROM album al
  JOIN artist a ON al.artist_id = a.id;
  ```
- Sample data for testing:

    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**BaseRepositoryTest.java** structure:
```java
@DataJpaTest
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE)
public abstract class BaseRepositoryTest {
    @Autowired
    protected TestEntityManager entityManager;

    protected void flushAndClear() {
        entityManager.flush();
        entityManager.clear();
    }
}
```

**Test Configuration** (application-test.properties):
```properties
# Repository tests use same H2 setup as main app
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb_repository

## E2E Testing Best Practices

### Test Data Helper
Create a `TestDataHelper.java` class to encapsulate test data creation:

```java
@Component
public class TestDataHelper {
    @Autowired
    private ArtistRepository artistRepository;

    @Autowired
    private SongRepository songRepository;

    @Autowired
    private AlbumRepository albumRepository;

    public Artist createArtist(String name) {
        Artist artist = new Artist();
        artist.setName(name);
        return artistRepository.save(artist);
    }

    public Song createSong(String title, Artist artist, Duration length, LocalDate releaseDate) {
        Song song = new Song();
        song.setTitle(title);
        song.setArtist(artist);
        song.setLength(length);
        song.setReleaseDate(releaseDate);
        return songRepository.save(song);
    }

    public Album createAlbum(String title, Artist artist, LocalDate releaseDate) {
        Album album = new Album();
        album.setTitle(title);
        album.setArtist(artist);
        album.setReleaseDate(releaseDate);
        return albumRepository.save(album);
    }

    public void createArtistWithSongsAndAlbums(String artistName, int songCount, int albumCount) {
        Artist artist = createArtist(artistName);

        for (int i = 0; i < songCount; i++) {
            createSong("Song " + i, artist, Duration.ofMinutes(3), LocalDate.now());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < albumCount; i++) {
            createAlbum("Album " + i, artist, LocalDate.now());
        }
    }
}
```

### Test Configuration (application-test.properties)
```properties
# Use separate H2 database for tests
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb_e2e
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop

# Disable WebSocket/JMS for tests (or configure test brokers)
spring.activemq.broker-url=vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false
```

### WebTestClient Usage Pattern
```java
// POST request
webTestClient.post()
    .uri("/api/artists")
    .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    .bodyValue(artistDto)
    .exchange()
    .expectStatus().isCreated()
    .expectBody(ArtistDto.class)
    .value(response -> {
        assertThat(response.getId()).isNotNull();
        assertThat(response.getName()).isEqualTo("Queen");
    });

// GET request with pagination
webTestClient.get()
    .uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder
        .path("/api/artists")
        .queryParam("page", 0)
        .queryParam("size", 20)
        .build())
    .exchange()
    .expectStatus().isOk()
    .expectBody(new ParameterizedTypeReference<PageImpl<ArtistListDto>>() {})
    .value(page -> {
        assertThat(page.getTotalElements()).isEqualTo(50);
        assertThat(page.getContent()).hasSize(20);
    });

// DELETE request
webTestClient.delete()
    .uri("/api/artists/{id}", artistId)
    .exchange()
    .expectStatus().isNoContent();

// Verify database state
assertThat(artistRepository.findById(artistId)).isEmpty();
```

### E2E Testing Strategy Summary

**Why E2E Testing with WebTestClient:**
- Tests the complete request/response cycle through the actual HTTP layer
- Validates JSON serialization/deserialization of DTOs
- Ensures proper HTTP status codes and response formats
- Tests pagination metadata and page navigation
- Validates error responses and exception handling
- Verifies entity relationships and cascade operations
- Tests real-time features (WebSocket, JMS)

**Test Organization:**
- **BaseE2ETest**: Common setup, database cleanup, shared utilities
- **TestDataHelper**: Reusable methods for creating test data
- **Dedicated test classes**: One per major feature area (Artist, Song, Album, Search, Pagination, Notifications)
- **Isolated tests**: Each test method is independent with its own setup/cleanup

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ All CRUD endpoints (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ All list endpoints with pagination
- ✅ Relationship management (songs on albums, cascade deletes)
- ✅ Search functionality across all entity types
- ✅ Pagination edge cases (empty results, single page, multiple pages)
- ✅ Sorting with pagination
- ✅ Error scenarios (404, 400, validation errors)
- ✅ WebSocket notification delivery
- ✅ JMS message publishing
- ✅ Database view queries (SearchResult)

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=ArtistE2ETest

# Run tests with coverage report
mvn test jacoco:report
```

## DTO Usage Examples

### Entity DTO (for single GET/POST/PUT):
```json
// GET /api/songs/1 response (SongDto):
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
  "length": "PT5M55S",
  "releaseDate": "1975-10-31",
  "artistId": 1,
  "albumIds": [1, 5]
}
```

### List DTO with Reference DTOs (for list/search responses):
```json
// GET /api/songs response (Page<SongListDto>):
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
      "length": "PT5M55S",
      "releaseDate": "1975-10-31",
      "artist": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Queen"
      },
      "albums": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "A Night at the Opera"
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "title": "Greatest Hits"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "totalElements": 100,
  "totalPages": 5,
  "currentPage": 0,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

### Album List DTO Example:
```json
// GET /api/albums/1/songs response (Page<SongRefDto>):
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "You're My Best Friend"
    }
  ],
  "totalElements": 12,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "currentPage": 0,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

### Search Result DTO Example:
```json
// GET /api/search?q=queen response (Page<SearchResultDto>):
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "entityType": "ARTIST",
      "name": "Queen",
      "artistName": "Queen",
      "releaseDate": null
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "entityType": "SONG",
      "name": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
      "artistName": "Queen",
      "releaseDate": "1975-10-31"
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "entityType": "ALBUM",
      "name": "A Night at the Opera",
      "artistName": "Queen",
      "releaseDate": "1975-11-21"
    }
  ],
  "totalElements": 3,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "currentPage": 0,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

---

## Technical Decisions

### Database Design
- **Many-to-Many**: Song-Album relationship via join table
- **Cascade Delete**: Artist deletion removes all associated content
- **Indexes**: On searchable fields (name, title)

### API Design
- **RESTful conventions**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **DTO Pattern**: Separate API models from database entities
- **Pagination**: Consistent across all list endpoints
- **Error handling**: Standardized error response format

### DTO Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Three types of DTOs for different use cases
  - **Entity DTOs** (`ArtistDto`, `SongDto`, `AlbumDto`):
    - Used for CRUD operations (Create, Update, single GET)
    - Contain only fields from the entity itself
    - Use IDs to reference related entities
    - Clean separation prevents circular dependencies

  - **Reference DTOs** (`ArtistRefDto`, `SongRefDto`, `AlbumRefDto`):
    - Lightweight objects containing just id and name/title
    - Used within List DTOs to represent related entities
    - Enable clients to display names and navigate to related resources
    - Prevent N+1 query problems by providing essential data upfront

  - **List DTOs** (`ArtistListDto`, `SongListDto`, `AlbumListDto`):
    - Used for list endpoints and search results
    - Embed Reference DTOs for related entities (not just IDs or names)
    - Contain aggregated data (counts, computed fields)
    - Optimized for display in lists with navigation capabilities

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket**: For browser/client notifications
- **JMS**: For internal service communication
- **Event-driven**: All write operations trigger notifications

### Benefits of Reference DTO Pattern
- **Client Navigation**: Clients can easily fetch related entities using provided IDs
- **Display-Ready**: Names/titles are included for immediate display without additional API calls
- **Performance**: Reduces the number of API calls needed by the client
- **Consistency**: Standardized way to represent entity relationships across the API
- **Flexibility**: Clients can choose to use just the name for display or the ID for navigation

### Database View for Search
- **Unified Search**: Single query across all entity types using UNION ALL
- **Database-Level Optimization**: Leverage database indexing and query optimization
- **Consistency**: Search logic is defined in SQL, not scattered across multiple repositories
- **Performance**: Avoids multiple queries and in-memory merging of results
- **Simplicity**: Read-only entity with @Immutable and @Subselect annotations
- **Type Discrimination**: entity_type field allows filtering and client-side routing
- **Denormalized Data**: Pre-joins artist names for efficient searching and display

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ **All CRUD operations functional** for Artist, Song, and Album
2. ✅ **Cascade delete working** - Artist deletion removes all associated data
3. ✅ **Pagination implemented** on all list endpoints (default size 20)
4. ✅ **Search API functional** with database view and substring matching
5. ⏸️ **WebSocket notifications working** for all write operations - PENDING Phase 7
6. ⏸️ **JMS messages publishing** for internal communication - PENDING Phase 7
7. ✅ **Clean separation** between DTOs (Entity, Reference, List, Search) - 10 DTOs created
8. ✅ **Service layer** properly abstracting business logic - 4 services implemented
9. ✅ **No direct repository access** from controllers - All controllers use services
10. ✅ **Proper error handling** and validation - GlobalExceptionHandler + @Valid annotations
11. ✅ **Comprehensive repository integration test suite** covering JPA mappings, queries, and database view
12. ✅ **All repository integration tests passing** - 42/42 tests passing
13. ✅ **Comprehensive E2E test suite** covering all endpoints and features (except Phase 7)
14. ✅ **All E2E tests passing** - 42/42 tests passing (84 total tests passing)
